# Azuree's Mini Games Hub

Welcome to **Azuree's Mini Games Hub**! This is a fun React-based web app built with **Vite** for fast development and great performance. Currently, the hub features the **Memory Game** as the first mini-game, but more games are planned for future updates.

## Features

- **Memory Game**: Match pairs of emojis in the least time and earn points!
- More games coming soon.

## Tech Stack

- **React**: A JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
- **Vite**: A fast build tool that improves the development experience with Hot Module Replacement (HMR).
- **Tailwind CSS**: A utility-first CSS framework used for styling the app.
- **React Router**: For managing navigation between different pages (such as the Hub and the Memory Game).
  

## Game Controls

Currently, only the Memory Game is available. In this game:
1. Choose a difficulty: Easy, Medium, or Hard.
2. Click to reveal tiles: Match the pairs of emojis before time runs out.
3. Return to the Hub: You can always navigate back to the home hub from the game screen.

## Future Features

- Additional mini-games such as Tic-Tac-Toe, Snake, Quiz Games, and more!
